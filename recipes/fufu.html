         <h3>Steps</h3>

             <ol>
                <li>Bring water to a boil in a pot.
                    Gradually pour the mixture of cassava and plantain flour into the boiling water while stirring continuously with a spatula to avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Once the fufu is cooked and smooth, remove it from the pot and transfer it to an earthenware bowl </li>
                <li>Use your hands and a wooden masher (or spatula) to shape the fufu into round, semi-flat balls.
                    Set the fufu aside, ready to be served with the soup.</li>
                <li>Wash the beef and place it in a pot.
                    Blend the garlic, ginger, onion, and habanero peppers into a smooth paste.</li>
                <li>Pour the blended mixture over the beef, add salt and seasoning cubes (if using), and cook over medium heat for about 10-15 minutes until the beef is semi-cooked.</li>
                 <li>In a separate pot, boil the garden eggs, tomatoes, and extra habanero peppers for about 5-10 minutes until soft.
                    Once boiled, blend the garden eggs, tomatoes, and peppers into a smooth mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour the blended tomato mixture into the pot with the semi-cooked beef.
                    Add the desired amount of water based on how thick or light you prefer your soup.
                    Stir the mixture well and bring it to a boil.</li>
                <li>Wash the okro thoroughly and trim off the tips and heads.
                    Add the whole okro to the soup, and allow it to boil along with the soup.</li>
                <li>Let the soup cook until the beef is tender, and the okro is fully cooked (about 15-20 minutes). </li>
                <li>Once the soup is ready, serve it hot with the prepared fufu.
                    Enjoy your delicious meal!</li>
